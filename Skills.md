# Skills
A skill is an ability that anybody can perform, but with training, you can become significantly more powerful than others. In Dawnfire RPG, skills fall into the following broad categories:
* Physical abilities, like running jumping, climbing, swimming, sneaking, et al.
* Social skills, like picking up on social cues, diplomacy, lying, and intimidating others
* Knowing things, about people, places, spells, demons, and other such nouns
* Combat skills, which make you more proficient with types of weapons and let you do more with them

Skills are listed in the following table, along with which ability score they are associated with and which category they fall into.

## Using Skills
Skills have two uses:
1. Passive benefits unlocked by being _highly trained_ in the skill
1. Special actions requiring a _skill check_ to measure success

To this end, let us discuss training skills and making skill checks.

### Training Skills

Each level, you receive a number of skill ranks. You may add a rank to any skill you choose, but the total ranks in a skill can never exceed your level.

### Making Skill Checks

A skill check is made as part of an action - see the different skill descriptions for what you can do using that skill. Roll 1d20, adding any ranks you have invested in that skill and the ability score relevant to that skill.

A natural 20 does not automatically succeed. If you cannot roll high enough to succeed even with a natural 20, you cannot perform that task. Your GM may choose to make exceptions and probably will, but this is the default rule.

A natural 1 does not automatically fail. If you cannot roll low enough to fail even with a natural 1, you cannot fail to perform that task. Your GM may choose to make exceptions and probably will, but this is the default rule.

## Acrobatics (Dex)

|Use|DC|
|---|---|
|High Jump|10 + 4 per foot|
|Long Jump|5 + 1 per foot|
|Balance on surface:||
|- 3 feet or wider|5|
|- 1 ft. to 3 ft.|10|
|- 6 in. to 1 ft.|15|
|- 3 in. to 6 in.|20|
|- 1 in. to 3 in.|25|
|- Less than 1 in.|30|
|Reduce fall damage:||
|- By 5 feet|20|
|- By 10 feet|30|
|__Modifiers:__||
|Surface is:||
|- Unsteady|+5|
|- Violently unsteady|+10|
|- Wet|+5|

### Jumping
High Jumping is the act of trying to get yourself as far up off the ground as possible. For Medium-sized characters, they can usually stretch their arms to 7 or 8 feet off the ground while standing, so grabbing something 10 feet up is only a DC 18. Small-sized characters can usually only stretch their arms 4 1/2 to 6 feet, with gnomes on the shorter end and kobolds on the taller. Grabbing something 10 feet up is DC 26 for them.

Long Jumping is the act of trying to get yourself as far as possible without touching the ground. If you have a sturdy pole to vault with, reduce the DC by 5.

_Optional extra realism_: Small-sized characters treat the High Jump DC as 10 + 3 per foot. In this case, grabbing something 10 feet up is DC 22. This is based on the Square-Cube Law.

## Bludgeoning Weapons (Str)
This skill teaches you to make more effective use of bludgeoning weapons, crushing enemy defenses and battering them into submission.

The Bludgeoning Weapon skill has no general-purpose skill checks associated with it.

* __1 Rank__: You add one-half your bludgeoning weapons skill ranks (minimum 1) as a bonus to all damage rolls with bludgeoning weapons.
* __3 Ranks__: You may choose to deal half damage on a standard attack or a Power Attack to also inflict [Staggered] 1. This does not stack with itself.
* __6 Ranks__: As a [Standard Action], make a single attack with a bludgeoning weapon. This attack has a -2 penalty on the attack roll and deals half damage. If it hits, your opponent's AC decreases by 2. This does not stack with itself. The penalty is removed when the armor is repaired (if the foe wears armor) or after 5 days (if the foe relies on natural armor).
* __9 Ranks__: As a [Standard Action], make a single attack with a bludgeoning weapon. This attack has a -2 penalty on the attack roll and deals half damage.
