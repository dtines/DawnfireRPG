# Character Creation

When making a character, there are several decisions you will have to make and several statistics you will have to generate. You should begin by coming up with a concept. That will inform the following parts of your character: 
* _Race_ is your character’s race. It affects your ability scores and your background.
* _Ability Scores_ describe your character’s basic physical and mental strengths and weaknesses. These affect many other numbers.
* _Class_ is what training your character has received. Your class determines what you can do and is the single most important decision you will make.

In addition, you have some choices that you will make at character creation that will come up again later in your adventuring career. These include:
* _Feats_ are special abilities that make your character uniquely skilled outside of their class. You get a feat at 1st level and every other level thereafter.
* _Skills_ are general abilities that everyone can do – things like balancing on a narrow ledge or remembering who the king is. You can train several skills every level.
* _Attunement Points_ let you bond with magic items and use their full potential. You get 1 Attunement Point at 2nd level, and one more every three levels thereafter.
* _Apotheoses_ are three powerful abilities you will get at 6th, 12th, and 18th level. They mark a culmination in your training as you purify and refine your own power.

For now, though, we will focus on the traits of a 1st-level character.

## Ability Scores
The next step in character creation is to generate your ability scores. To do this, roll 3d6 six times, and lookup the corresponding result on the following table. You may assign these numbers to any of the six ability scores you choose. Then, add any racial modifiers to get your final ability scores.

|Roll|Ability Score| |Roll|Ability Score|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1  |0  |   |11 |3  |
|2  |0  |   |12 |4  |
|3  |1  |   |13 |4  |
|4  |1  |   |14 |4  |
|5  |1  |   |15 |5  |
|6  |1  |   |16 |5  |
|7  |2  |   |17 |5  |
|8  |2  |   |18 |5  |
|9  |2  |   |19 |6  |
|10 |3  |   |20 |6  |

__Strength__ is your character’s physical power. Your Strength is added to your melee attack rolls and martial damage rolls. It is important for Barbarians, Fighters, and any character who wants to excel in melee combat.  
__Dexterity__ is your character’s agility and speed. Your Dexterity is added to your ranged attack rolls and your initiative. It is important for Monks and Rogues.  
__Constitution__ is your character’s physical endurance. Your Constitution is added to your health. It is important to all characters, especially Monsters.  
__Intelligence__ is your character’s cunning and reasoning. Your Intelligence is added to magical damage rolls. It is important to Artificers and Wizards, and any character who wants many skills.

## Other Statistics
Now that you have your ability scores, you can calculate several other numbers:
* _Armor Class_ represents how difficult you are to hit in combat, both from having tough armor and from knowing when to sidestep. Your AC is 10 + your Dexterity. Your equipment may increase this.
* _Spell Resistance_ is your resistance to magic, both through strong willpower, magical countermeasures, and just getting out of the way. Your SR is 10 + your Wisdom. Your equipment may increase this.
* _Initiative_ measures your reactions in combat, determining how quickly you act. Your initiative is your Dexterity.
* _Hit Points_ determine how much punishment you can take before you go down. Your base HP is 4 + your Constitution + your Charisma. Each time you level up, add your base HP to your current hit point total to determine your new hit point total. At first level, your hit point total is equal to twice your base HP.
