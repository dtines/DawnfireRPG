# Mage
Mages are powerful magic-users, casually brushing aside the veil of the mundane to see beyond and harness the true and terrible powers that lie there.

__Skills__: Mages receive 5 skill ranks each level which they may assign as they see fit.

__Proficiencies__: Mages are proficient with all magic weapons and robes, but not martial weapons, armor, or shields.

## Class Abilities
The following are class abilities of the mage.

### Magic-User
Fundamentally, a Mage is one who uses magic. At 1st level, a Mage learns any two spells. As long as the Mage can pay the casting cost, there is no restriction on how often spells can be cast.

### School Initiation
At 2nd level, a Mage specializes into one of six magical schools, each focused on their own mysteries and granting their own special abilities. This is a permanent choice the Mage must make.

At 2nd level, 5th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, up to 20th level, the school grants the Mage another ability. Each school, and their associated abilities, are listed at the end of this section.

### See Beyond
By 4th level, a Mage has started to see past the limits of the mortal realm. The Mage gains an ability called Magic-Sight. It is an [Instant Action] to turn it on or off. Each [Round] or fraction thereof it is turned on costs the Mage 1 [HP Reduction].

With Magic-Sight, magical weapons, enchanted items, and magical effects glow, revealing themselves. Any ordinary blockers of light also block this glow. This light is bright enough for a Mage to see or fight by. You can tell if a creature is under a spell, but not the nature of the spell. [Invisible] and [Ethereal] creatures appear as a faint shimmer to you, and you treat them as [Fully Concealed] instead of [Invisible]. The added information grants a +3 bonus to SR.

While using Magic-Sight, your eyes glow. The exact color varies - usually gold, blue, or violet - but it is unmistakable and reveals you as a Mage, unless you obscure your eyes.

### Wizardly Glare
When a Mage reaches 7th level, they start to perfect the withering stare common to disappointed grandmothers and angry wizards. By spending a [Standard Action] staring down a creature within 60 feet, the Mage may inflict [Energy Drained] 1 on that creature as long as the Mage continues staring.

After starting a stare, it only takes a [Fast Action] to maintain. Each [Round] the [Energy Drained] increases by 1, to a maximum of one-half the Mage's level. While staring, the Mage treats all other creatures as [Concealed].

The other creature does not have to look at the Mage (and indeed, they rarely manage to). This does not work through mirrors or other reflections.

### Focus Power
Upon reaching 10th level, a Mage learns to focus power within themselves. By spending a [Standard Action] gathering power, a Mage gains a +2 bonus to the attack roll and any checks or contests for the next spell they cast. This spell must be cast before the end of the Mage's next turn.

By Focusing Power multiple times in a row, the Mage may stack this bonus up to twice their level. The spell can be partially cast alongside Focusing Power as long as it is finished casting within 1 [Round] of the final Focusing of Power.

This creates a reasonable amount of noise and light and swirling dust and other dramatic special effects. A Mage may suppress these, but doing so requires 3 [HP Reduction] per [Round] spent Focusing Power.

# Mage Schools

## Alchemical
This school focuses on the interplay between objects and magic. Its adherents are adept at binding spells to objects, creating potions, wands, staves, and other magical devices.

Each time you gain an ability from this school, you also learn a spell from the following list. If you already know all these spells, you may instead learn any spell.
* Spell 1
* Spell 2
* Spell 3
* Spell 4
* Spell 5
* Spell 6
* Spell 7
* Spell 8
* Spell 9
* Spell 10

### Potion-Making
At 2nd level, you learn to create liquid variants of spells. Potions are made from a special spell-capturing broth that takes about an hour to brew - the act of storing spells in it is quite quick. You can create any number of potions in one hour, but must pay all their casting costs. You may have up to your Charisma active potions; making any more causes the oldest active potion to become inert. Otherwise, potions last indefinitely and can be used by any creature. They even last after your death.

Potions do not store an exact replica of the spell. They always follow these rules:
* A potion has a single target, either the square where it breaks, the creature that drinks it, or the object it is poured over.
* For spells with variable durations or that can be dismissed, the potion always lasts as long as possible.
* If the spell has to roll any d20s as part of its casting, it rolls a 13. For all other numbers, it uses its creator's statistics.

Particularly vindictive or realistic GMs may rule that potions exposed to extreme heat or extreme cold (usually only from breath weapons or area spells) have a 1-in-6 chance of breaking, possibly triggering their effects.

## Combat
This school focuses on the intricacies of magical combat, both on the offensive and defensive side. These mages learn many wards alongside devastatingly destructive spells.

## Death
This controversial school studies negative energy and undeath. Those who follow its teachings can sap the strength of the living and create and control undead.

Each time you gain an ability from this school, you also learn a spell from the following list. If you already know all these spells, you may instead learn any spell.
* Spell 1
* Spell 2

### Channel Negative Energy
At 2nd level, you can channel [Negative] energy through you. This affects either all living creatures within 15 feet or all undead creatures within 15 feet, and deals 3d8 + your Charisma [Negative] energy damage. This takes a [Standard Action] and 5 [HP Reduction]. You may choose to include yourself or not as part of the appropriate effect.

## Life
An ever-popular school emphasizing life and healing. These mages can heal almost any affliction, transfigure the living, ward off undead, and protect against injury or death.

* Spell 1
* Spell 2
* Spell 3
* Spell 4

### Channel Positive Energy
At 2nd level, you can channel [Positive] energy through you. This affects either all living creatures within 15 feet or all undead creatures within 15 feet, and deals 3d8 + your Charisma [Positive] energy damage. This takes a [Standard Action] and 5 [HP Reduction]. You may choose to include yourself or not as part of the appropriate effect.

## Time
This esoteric school focuses on the flow of time and its relationship with magic. Its adherents learn to bind spells to one another, casting multiple at once, or in quick succession, or automatically triggering them on certain conditions.

Each time you gain an ability from this school, you also learn a spell from the following list. If you already know all these spells, you may instead learn any spell.
* Spell 1
* Spell 2

* Spell 5
* Spell 6
* Spell 7

### Dual Casting
At 2nd level, Time Mages learn to handle multiple spells with ease. They automatically succeed on concentration checks to maintain partially-cast spells. They may maintain a spell as an [Instant Action], but still must use a [Fast Action] to progress casting it. It is not feasible to use this to store partially-cast spells at all times - down that road lies a crippling migraine.

### Fast Casting
At 5th level, Time Mages can cast their spells faster than usual. They reduce the casting time for all their spells by 1 AP, to a minimum of 0 AP. This does not stack with any other ability that decreases casting time.

## World
This broad school studies magic and the world itself. They learn myriad forms of mundane utility, controlling inanimate objects, travelling supernaturally quickly, and undoing magic.

Each time you gain an ability from this school, you also learn a spell from the following list. If you already know all these spells, you may instead learn any spell.
* Spell 1
* Spell 2
* Spell 3
* Spell 4
* Spell 5
* Spell 6
* Spell 7
* Spell 8
* Spell 9
* Spell 10

### Nature Blessed

At 2nd level, World Mages see power in nature. You do not leave tracks if you do not choose to and are [Immune] to nonmagical difficult terrain. You always succeed at skill checks to forage for food. When rolling to navigate, you may reroll any failures once. If you fail on the reroll, you become lost as normal.
