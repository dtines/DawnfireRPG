# Magic Items
A magic item is several things:
* It is a source of power or a new ability,
* It can be removed or lost, and
* It is one of the most remarkable facets of a character.

King Arthur's mythos is well-known, but its two most popular components are Excalibur and the Holy Grail. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has, thus far, revolved around the Infinity Stones. The flying carpet and the Genie's lamp are both integral parts of Aladdin. The flaming sword appears in the Bible. Freyr's magic sword fought on its own. Circe's staff turned men into animals. Odin's spear Gungnir could never miss. Thor's belt Megingjord gave him (more) strength, while Aphrodite's magic girdle made anyone she desired fall in love with her. Freyja's cloak let her turn into a falcon and fly. Magic items are everywhere, and no good RPG is complete without them.

Hence, this chapter.

## Getting Magic Items
You may attune to 1 magic item at 3rd level, +1 every other level thereafter. There is no limit on how many magic items you can have. Magic items are incredibly possessive and want to be used exclusively; if you attune to two that are similar, the old one immediately detunes from you. You can only attune to one item from each of the following categories:

* Weapon (i.e., swords, bows, spears)
* Staves, Wands
* Armor
* Shields
* Cloaks, Capes, Robes, Body Coverings
* Belts
* Boots, Sandals, Foot Coverings
* Gauntlets, Gloves, Hand Coverings
* Amulets, Scarves, Neck Coverings

In addition, you can attune to multiple of the following categories, though neither category can be more than one-half your magic items (rounded up):

* Rings, Ring Sets, Finger Coverings
* Miscellaneous Non-worn Objects (card decks, crystal balls, candles, cauldrons...)

Most correctly, you should be going on quests or purchasing magic items as you go, and then attuning to a magic item you already possess when you level up.

## Sentience and Sapience of Magic Items
Magic items are spaient, but not sentient. They are aware of their surroundings, often using bizarre and unknown senses, but they have no conscious thought and often have no means by which to act on their awareness. They do not have proper emotions, but do have a sense of "Am I being used well or poorly?" In very rare circumstances, they will even rebel against their wielders. For the most part, though, all your magic items will do is detune if you attune to a new one.

If you want a better sense of this, read Lord of the Rings - especially for the emphasis that the One Ring _wants_ certain things, though it cannot truly act on these desires. This willfulness is (part of) what made the One Ring such a dreadful and dagnerous burden, and it is what these magic items also possess.

## Magic Weapons
All magic weapons have a Tier, between 1 and 5, with Tier-1 magic weapons being the weakest and Tier-5 being the strongest. A magic item always adds its tier to its attack and damage rolls. In addition, it gains enchantments equal to its tier, with common enchantments listed below. Custom magic items should be in line with these power levels, and run by your GM for approval. Some examples and some custom weapons follow.

### 1 Tier Cost Enchantments
* __Corrosive__: This weapon deals an additional 2d8 [Acid] damage.
* __Flaming__: This weapon deals an additional 2d8 [Fire] damage.
* __Ghost Touch__: This weapon deals [Force] damage instead of [Physical] damage, and can be manipulated by ethereal creatures.
* __Icy__: This weapon deals an additional 2d8 [Cold] damage.
* __Masterwork__: This weapon has an additional weapon modifier.
* __Seeking__: This weapon ignores any [Concealment] and resulting [Miss Chances] the target may have. Can only be applied to ranged weapons.
* __Shocking__: This weapon deals an additional 2d8 [Electricity] damage.
* __Shrinking__: This weapon can be shrunk to miniature size or enlarged as a [Free Action]. While shrunk, it does not take up an inventory slot.
* __Throwing__: This weapon can be used as a ranged weapon within 30 feet, and automatically returns to your hand. Can only be applied to melee weapons.
### 2 Tier Cost Enchantments
* __Cleaving__: ?
* __Contaminated__: 
* __Disruption__: This weapon deals 2d12 bonus damage to undead.
* __Dragonbane__: This weapon deals 2d12 bonus damage to dragons.
* __Sharpshooter__: This weapon ignores any [Cover] or [Concealment] the target may have. Can only be applied to ranged weapons.
* __Potent__: Double bonus damage from enchantments.
* __Spell Storing__: 
* __Venemous__: 
* __Wounding__: This weapon inflicts [Bleeding] 1 whenever it deals damage. This stacks with itself, but not with other sources of [Bleeding]. One Heal check stops all [Bleeding] from this enchantment.
### 3 Tier Cost Enchantments
* __Asmeric__: This weapon counts as thunderbolt iron, even if it is made from another material. It deals an additional 4d8 [Fire] damage, and doubles the enchantment bonus on attack rolls for Standard or Power Attacks.
* __Brilliant Energy__: The weapon is wholly composed of light and glows like a torch. It ignores bonuses to AC from armor or shields, but you may not add Strength to its attack or damage rolls.
* __Dancing__: The weapon can be dropped as an [Instant Action] to fight on its own. It can be directed as a [Fast Action] to target a foe within 30 feet, at which point it makes one Standard Attack against them each [Round]. You may recall it as a [Standard Action] if you have a free hand - otherwise, it falls to the ground after 4 [Rounds].
* __Faerie__: 
* __Homing__: This weapon shoots around corners to strike its foe. It need not fire in a straight line, but cannot fire outside of its range. This allows it to ignore [Cover] and [Concealment], though you still must know the target is there. This can only be applied to ranged weapons.
* __Infernal__: 
* __Speed__: This weapon is abnormally swift. You receive 1 [Bonus AP] per [Round], but may only use it to attack with this weapon.
* __Vorpal__: This weapon is adept at beheading foes. Critical hits from Standard or Power Attacks behead the target, (usually) killing them instantly. This can only be put on a slashing melee weapon.

### Custom Magic Weapons

#### Angelic Doomblade
_+5 Potent Asmeric Thunderbolt Iron Longsword_  
This thunderbolt iron longsword is alight with cyan flames, like a fire the color of the clear blue sky. It shines with holy light, bringing any darkness to bright light within 60 feet, or to normal light within 120 feet. This even affects supernatural darkness. Your AC increases by 2 while wielding this weapon. It deals 2d8 + Strength + one-half level [Physical] + 8d8 [Fire] damage on a hit. On Standard and Power Attacks, its bonus to attack rolls increases to +10 from its usual +5. Critical 19-20 x2, range 5 feet.

#### Psychic Arrow
_+4 Homing Throwing [Devastating] [Heartseeker] Shiv_  
This slender dart glows slightly with orange energy, brighter while in use. It can fly anywhere within 30 feet at your direction, attacking targets anywhere within range, and returning to you afterward. It has a +4 bonus to attack rolls, deals 1d4 + Intelligence damage, and has a critical range of 17-20 x5. It completely ignores any [Cover] or [Concealment] a target has.

## Staves and Wands
Staves and Wands exist for two reasons - to output large, uncontrolled, and destructive quantities of magical energy on a whim, and to cast spells without exhausting oneself. Wands are a simpler version of staves, being less powerful but simpler to make and more available.

A damaging wand targets a single creature, and deals damage as a rod normally does, of either [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], [Fire], or [Force]. It can then be enchanted as a normal magic weapon (see the previous section).

A damaging staff that uses [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], [Fire], or [Force] deals damage to all creatures in a 10-ft radius burst. Staves dealing [Positive] or [Negative] damage only deal 2d8 base damage and target single creatures. Either can then be enchanted as a normal magic weapon (see the previous section).

Spellcasting wands and staves store either a single spell (wands) or several (staves). They allow you to cast these spells, even if you do not know the spell yourself. In addition, the wand or staff can store units of magical energy called "charges" - 20 in a wand, 50 in a staff. Each day, you take 2 [HP Reduction] per unfilled charge in the wand or staff, filling it up - or as nearly as possibly while leaving you alive. Then, when casting a spell from the wand/staff, you may expend 1 or more charges, each reducing the casting cost by 5 [HP Reduction]. When casting a spell with the wand/staff in hand but not from it, you may still spend charges, each reducing the casting cost by 1 [HP Reduction].

Many wands and staves have other minor effects. As with custom magic weapons, you should run new wands and staves by your GM for approval. Some examples follow:

#### Staff of Volcanic Bursts
_+3 Speed Damaging [Fire] Staff_  
This staff deals 3d8 [Fire] damage to all creatures in a 10-ft radius burst centered within 120 feet. Its critical threshold is 20 and its critical multiplier is x2. You receive a +3 bonus on attack rolls with this staff. Each [Round], you also receive 1 [Bonus AP] that can only be used to attack with the staff.

#### Staff of Frost and Flame
_Staff of: Fireball, Cone of Cold_  
This cypress staff thrums with noticeable power while fully charged, and always feels warm to the touch despite being capped with frost on each end. It contains the spells Fireball and Cone of Cold. For 1 [Round] after casting either spell, it only counts as containing the other.
