# Rogue
Tinkering tricksters, rogues are the sneak-thiefs and mad scientists that will herald a new age. They are best suited to finding ways around encounters, circumventing obstacles and achieving through stealth, trickery, gadgetry, or manipulation what others would do through violence. They are guile heroes, through and through.

__Skills__: Rogues receive 5 skill ranks each level which they may assign as they see fit.

__Proficiencies__: Rogues are proficient with one-handed martial weapons, light or medium armor, light or heavy shields, wands and rods, and white or grey robes.

## Class Abilities
The following are class abilities of the rogue.

### Archetypical
Labeled and sidelined by the rest of society, rogues tend to fall into one of several archetypes. These are listed at the end of this class, and they grant the Rogue many special abilities. The Rogue permanently chooses one at 1st level, gaining an ability from it. They gain another ability from their Archetype at 4th level.

### Finesse Fighter
When a Rogue reaches 2nd level, they learn to fight with their agility and precision rather than relying on large weapons, overwhelming strength, or powerful armor. They use their Dexterity in place of their Strength for all martial attack and damage rolls, and add their Intelligence to their AC as long as they are not wearing armor.

### Daredevil
Upon reaching 5th level, a Rogue seems just plain lucky. As part of making a d20 roll, the Rogue may activate this ability. They roll 3d8 instead of 1d20, and take 4 [HP Reduction]. A roll of 20 or higher are all treated as natural 20s if that matters.

### Second Archetype
At 7th level, a Rogue begins to play to multiple stereotypes, diversifying their strengths. They permamently select a second archetype that they can select archetype powers from.

When selecting a new power from their first archetype, the Rogue may choose up to 1 + their level divided by 3, rounded up. When selecting a new power from their second archetype, they may choose up to their level divided by 3, rounded up.

The Rogue immediately gains a new archetype power, and gains another at 10th level.

### Try, Try Again
At 8th level, a Rogue's preternatural ability to twist things their way intensifies. When a Rogue fails a check or contest, they may accept 5 [HP Reduction] to immediately roll again with a +1 bonus. This bonus is cumulative, if the Rogue rolls multiple times in a row.

### Twist Away
When a Rogue reaches 11th level, they are increasingly skilled at getting out of the way. When attacked, targeted by a spell, or included in part of a harmful area effect, the Rogue may use a [Reaction] to move up to 15 feet. If they get out of range, the attack does not affect them.

If they are still affected after using this ability, they still receive a +4 bonus on any Dexterity checks or contests created as part of the effect.

### Third Archetype
At 13th level, the Rogue unlocks a final, third archetype to select powers from. They again gain an immediate power. They can select powers at the following ranks at the following levels:

|Level|First Archetype|Second Archetype|Third Archetype|
|13|5|4|3|
|16|5|5|4|
|19|5|5|5|

### Flawless Execution
Upon reaching 14th level, the Rogue can do the impossible: not screw up in the first place. By spending 1 additional AP than usually required for an action, the Rogue may select the result of their d20 instead of rolling. For example, the Rogue could make a Quick Attack as a [Standard Action] and pick the d20 roll, or make it as a [Fast Action] and roll normally.

### Double Team
At 17th level, the Rogue can create a shadowy double of them that is quasi-real. This is a [Fast Action] costing 15 [HP Reduction], and creates the double somewhere within 30 feet. The double lasts 8 [Rounds]. Both the Rogue and the double can take damage from attacks, but both take half-damage. Targeted spells may freely target either, but have a 50% miss chance. While the double is active, the Rogue receives 4 AP per [Round] and may use these with either body.

When the duration is up, or when the Rogue dismisses this ability as an [Instant Action], the Rogue may reappear in either double's position. While active, the Rogue and the double are indistinguishable, both appearing shadowy, indistinct, and not entirely real.

### According to Plan

# Archetypes

## The Breaker
These are those burly bullies that bash in other people's kneecaps, quietly garroting quarrelsome fools in the forest or back allies.

### Cruelty
At 1st level, when you make an attack, you can choose to halve the damage to also inflict [Staggered] for 1 [Round]. This does not stack with itself, and does not work with Fast Attacks.

## The Maker
The mad scientists of tomorrow, these Rogues create gadgets and tools to serve almost any purpose.

### Gadgetry I
At 1st level, you learn to make basic gadgets. Choose one of the following:
* __Flashbang__: These small canisters pop when struck firmly, letting off a blinding flash and a deafening bang... hence the name. You can throw one against a hard surface within 30 feet to set it off as a [Fast Action] costing 6 [HP Reduction]. Enemies within 15 feet of the flashbang are [Staggered] for 1 [Round] and make a Dexterity contest with you (you only roll once and use the same value for all contests). If they lose, they are also [Blinded] for 1d4 [Rounds] and [Deafened] for 1d6 [Rounds].
* __Smoke Bomb__: This takes a [Standard Action] to set off, which includes tossing it into a square within 30 feet and spending 1 [HP Reduction]. It then fills up a 15-ft aura with thick fog. Adjacent creatures in the cloud have [Concealment], while creatures further apart have [Full Concealment]. The cloud lasts 10 [Rounds], but a stiff breeze will disperse it in 3 [Rounds], and fire will burn it away.

## The Mover
Acrobats and free-runners, these Rogues are masters of getting to hard-to-reach places, eventually even ignoring the pesky laws of physics.

### Sprinter
At 1st level, your movement speed increases by 10 feet, plust 5 feet for each archetype power you gain hereafter.

## The Sneakster
The person you never knew was there, slinking past unnoticed, waiting patiently, striking from the shadows.

### Hide in Shadows
While everyone can hide, at 1st level, you can hide even without something to hide behind. This ability only works when you have something to disappear into - usually a patch of darkness or a crowd. In addition, you add one-half your level as a bonus to all Stealth checks.

## The Speaker
Politicians and charismatic manipulators, these Rogues bludgeon their enemies with words, rhetoric, and convincing arguments.

### Interruption
Even at 1st level, your voice has such stopping power that you can give any creature pause. This is a [Reaction] that can be used to interrupt another creature's action, and it costs you 5 [HP Reduction]. Creatures 4 or more levels above you are [Immune] to this ability, unless you are in a position of authority over them.

## The Taker
Kleptomaniac extraordinaires, these are those people who take anything not nailed down, and frankly many things that are.

### Pickpocket
At 1st level, you are a skilled pickpocket. You can work a crowd exactly like working a job to earn money. In addition, you add one-half your level (minimum 1) as a bonus to Larceny checks to take a small object, such a keys from a guard or a ring from a baron.

## The Thinker
Sitting quietly in dark rooms coming up with elaborate plots, these Rogues are chessmasters, planning out everything in advance.

### Saw It Coming
At 1st level, you add your Intelligence to your AC and SR.
