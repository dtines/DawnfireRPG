## Combat Maneuvers

### Charge
This is a [Slow Action]. Move up to your movement speed in a straight line, at least 10 feet, ending your movement adjacent to an enemy. Then make a single melee attack. You receive a +2 bonus on the attack roll and add your level to the damage. If you have special abilities that affect Power Attacks, you can choose to activate them on this attack.

### Quick Attack
This is a [Fast Action]. Make an attack. If the attack roll hits, the attack automatically does minimum damage.

### Power Attack
This is a [Slow Action]. Make an attack. If the attack roll hits, you deal normal damage but roll the weapon's damage dice twice.

Example: The damage dice for a Longsword are 2d8, with Strength and one-half the wielder's level added to damage. On a Power Attack, the wielder rolls 4d8, adding their Strength and one-half their level.
