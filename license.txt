COPYRIGHT
The original creator of this project retains copyright to the project. Contributions by others to this repository are included under this copyright (that is to say, the contributor does not have copyright over their contribution).

A contributor always has permission to replicate and publish their contributions, but not any other parts of this project. A contributor who duplicates their contribution into this project and another project may still distribute the other project comercially (and still may not distribute this project comercially). In short, a contributor may not be harmed by their contribution's copyright belonging with this project.

Rationale: Copyright is centralized to streamline any lawsuits that arise, and to empower the original creator to defend the whole creation on behalf of all contributors. The centralized copyright is not intended to limit an individual's ability to contribute, nor their ability to use their own ideas in other projects.
