# The Cosmos

Magic is generally thought of as an all-powerful art by which one may do the conventionally impossible. This is inaccurate, bordering on utterly false.

Magic is the art of first altering the magical realm and then applying those changes to the mundane realm. Thus, one resistant to magic could safely stand in the middle of a wizard's fireball. Relatedly, a gunpowder explosion will knock down doors, but a wizard's fireball will not (unless the wizard remembers to copy that effect into the real world). These same patterns work in reverse as well - a sword may be lethal to mundane creatures, but it does not "reach" into the magical world.

There are five realms, all of which are somewhat separate. Here are there general relations to each other:

|Realm|Strong Against|Resistant To|Weak Against|Vulnerable To|Denizens|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mundane|Primal|Magical|Infernal|Celestial|Normal people and animals, constructs|The ordinary world.|
|Magical|Infernal|Celestial|Mundane|Primal|Elementals, some aberrations, spells|A dusty, flickery imitation world, like the real world made of silvered glass and shadow. With magic-sight, it bursts into vibrant color.|
|Celestial|Mundane|Primal|Magical|Infernal|The Asmer, possibly deities|Unknown. The only to venture there are the irrecoverable dead.|
|Infernal|Celestial|Mundane|Primal|Magical|Demons, daemons, djinni, other spirits.|Bleak wastelands and fiery caverns under a stormy sky. Beautiful, though blasted.|
|Primal|Magical|Infernal|Celestial|Mundane|Faeries, nature spirits|A vibrant world of overlarge mountains, primeval forests, crystal lakes, and floating isles.|

### Charged Materials
Some materials are associated with a certain realm and can often be used to bypass weaknesses. These are invaluable for the nonmagical fighter:
* __Thunderbolt iron__ is not a form of iron, but something else entirely. Sometimes called adamantine. Charged with Celestial energy, it is good against worldly monsters and constructs.
* __Iron, steel__ and other iron alloys (esp. Damascus steel) are all charged with mundane energy, making them supernaturally powerful against faeries and other fey beasts.
* __Silver and mithril__ are both powerfully magical metals, good against any rogue demons, daemons, djinni, ghosts, or other miscellaneous spirits.
* __Lich Bone__ is made from powdered bone and the blossoms of a rare, gnarled tree (or from lich bones). It is a potent source of infernal energy, and hacks through celestials easily.
* __Lead__ is, strangely enough, charged with primal energy, and does not burn the fey or inhibit their magic. It shorts out most conventional magic, and is supereffective against magical beasts.

## Other Denizens of the Cosmos

### The Asmer
The Asmer are not angels, but they do not correct the common confusion. They are the only known beings to venture to or from the Celestial realm, and they keep it secret. Appearing as messengers for deities, to battle powerful demons, or to smite aspirational mages, they are secretive, rare, and terrifyingly powerful neighbors in the cosmos.

Weak Asmer usually take winged humanoid forms with skin like gemstones, or use illusions to appear similar to whomever they speak with. More powerful Asmer cannot be bothered with such pleasantries, appearing as wreaths of flame, a ghostly apparition of dust and light, or nothing at all.

### Demons
Demons are malevolent spirits from the Infernal realm. They take a wide range of forms, but generally resemble twisted mockeries of normal animals. Their kind has no true hierarchy, though the self-proclaimed demon lords would have you think otherwise. Demons spend much of their time trying to corrupt mortals - whether this is how they create more demons or solely for their perverse amusion is unknown.

Demons are resistant to most ordinary weapons and attacks from the mortal realm. Spells work well, and many mages have bound demons to their service before. If one must use a nonmagical weapon, silver and mithril are best.

### Djinni, Daemons
Djinni and Daemons are the other common inhabitants of the Infernal realm, though they are not as malevolent. Daemons often have warped and twisted worldviews, and are eager to serve in certain capacities. Djinni have an elaborate culture, and can make good trade partners or mentors.

Djinni tend to appear as humanoids between 8 and 10 feet tall, with multicolored skin. Daemons appear as bestial to the extreme, often a horrible mismash of different creatures. Getting past their appearance is the first challenge to a wizard looking to make use of them.

### Elementals
Elementals are the equivalent of animals on the magical plane. They are often created from spare spell energy, and they are similarly single-minded, raw, abrasive, and destructive. It is almost impossible to reason with them, if they can even communicate. Elementals can be tapped directly for magical power, if one is comfortable with the moral implications and has the know-how.

Appearance varies on how they were made. Earth elementals are rocky and stony, while Fire elementals are twisting forms of smoke and flame. Water elementals are rushing water and ice, while Wood elementals are twisted vines and leaves. Metal elementals are unique, appearing as swirling dust, or totally invisible. All tend to appear in normal animal forms - dogs, eagles, bears, deer, and badgers are all common.
