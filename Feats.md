# Feats
Introduction

Rules

## General Feats

### Fast Caster
__Prerequisites__: 6th level  
__Benefit__: Decrease the casting time for all spells by 1 AP, but not below 0 AP. This does not stack with any other ability that decreases casting time.

### Hide In Shadows
__Prerequisites__: 4th level
__Benefit__: You can hide even without something to hide behind. You must still have something to blend into - typically a patch of darkness or a crowd. Some esoteric or magical senses are significantly more difficult to fool.

### Learn Spell
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: You learn a spell. You can choose to learn a spell that you cannot cast yet (though this may be a poor decision). You may take this feat multiple times.

### Share Strength
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: As a [Standard Action], you can accept 5 [HP Reduction] to remove 4 [HP Reduction] from a creature you touch.

### Wall-Runner
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: You can (briefly) run on walls. You must move at least 10 feet over solid ground before, and you must end your movement on solid ground again or fall. Running up a wall is considered difficult terrain (it costs 10 feet of movement to go up 5 feet). While adjacent to a wall, you can treat your movement as on the ground or on the wall - that is, you may run 10 feet next to the wall and then move 5 feet forward and transition to running on the wall as one step. Similarly, if you end your movement on the bottom square of a wall, you do not fall.

## Combat Feats

### Attrition Fighter
__Prerequisites__: 9th level  
__Benefit__: When you take [Physical] damage from an adjacent enemy, they take your Consitution [Physical] damage.

### Combat Opportunist
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: You look for opportunities in combat, and you take them. As a [Reaction], you may make a single melee attack against a foe that leaves a square adjacent to you, unless they used a 5-foot step to do so.

### Vicious Combat Opportunist
__Prerequisites__: Combat Opportunist  
__Benefit__: You are more aggressive about punishing opening. When an adjacent enemy makes an attack against a creature other than you, you may use a [Reaction] to make a single melee attack against them.

### Riposting Combat Opportunist
__Prerequisites__: Vicious Combat Opportunist  
__Benefit__: When an adjacent enemy misses an attack against you, you may use a [Reaction] to make a single melee attack against them.

### Ranged Combat Opportunist
__Prerequisites__: Combat Opportunist  
__Benefit__: You can make opportunistic attacks at range. You can make [Reaction] attacks based on Combat Opportunist or other feats that require it from 5 feet further away, and may do so with a ranged weapon.

### Make Some Space
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: As a [Standard Action], you may attempt to push an adjacent creature away from you. Make a Strength contest against the creature. If they are not opposing you, treat their result as a 10. For every 3 points by which you beat them, they are [Knocked Back] 5 feet. If you fail, nothing happens.

### Parry
__Prerequisites__: none  
__Benefit__: If you are aware of an attack, you can parry it as a [Reaction]. Add your initiative + your Strength to your AC against this one attack.

### Riposte
__Prerequisites__: Parry  
__Benefit__: If an attack that you attempted to Parry misses, you may make an attack against the attacker as an [Immediate Action]. This is always a Quick Attack - it deals minimum damage.
