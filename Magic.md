# Magic
Magic is the act of imposing your will on the magical world and forcing those changes into the real world. It is a tricky and subtle art that can be performed any number of ways. The most elaborate is _Ritual Magic_, requiring hours and exacting precision to set up and cast. The more common form is _Simplified Ritual Magic_, which uses a number of shortcuts to achieve basic magical effects with only a few gestures and words. The other extreme involves a number of related families and can only be performed by special extraplanar beings - typically faerie and daemons.

This chapter includes the rules for learning and casting according to Simplified Ritual Magic. Ritual Magic is sufficiently complicated and old that it is almost extinct, outside of a few summoners who cannot simplify their arts.

## Learning A Spell
Spells are usually learned by taking the feat Learn Spell, as part of a class feature, or as part of an apprenticeship with an older mage. This is not a straightforward undertaking and requires a fair amount of testing different approaches and tweaking the spell formula - even if you generally know how it works. Learning a spell should always take at least 1 week. As feats and class features, it is assumed you did this work ahead of time, and the feat or class feature represents the work paying off.
