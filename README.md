# Dawnfire RPG
A Table-top role-playing game by Joseph Abolt

## What is this?
A table-top role-playing game, like Dungeons & Dragons. The main reasons to play this and not something else are:
* __Adaptability__: These rules can and will change over time, allowing much smaller-scale tweaks than what properly-published systems can release.
* __Simple rules__: We've tried to streamline some things, such as getting rid of resource pools and simplifying action economy in combat. This makes it more friendly to new players.
* __Full-fledge content__: It may be lacking at the moment, but this is planned to be as grand as any RPG despite its simplicity.

## How do I start playing?
We'll put together some more details on the wiki shortly. For now, keep the ```Terms.md``` file handy for game terms - anything surrounding [square brackets] is defined there. Then check out ```Character Creation Intro.md``` and ```Classes Intro```, both of which will help you get started. From there, look at the file for your class, or at Spells, Equipment, Magic Items, Feats, or Skills (order is less important for those).

## How do I start contributing?
Start by reading some of the system so you know what is already there. Then, check out the [guidelines on the wiki](https://github.com/joeabolt/DawnfireRPG/wiki/Contributing). After that, go ahead and branch off, make your additions, and submit a pull request!

## I have a question...
Make sure you check the [wiki](https://github.com/joeabolt/DawnfireRPG/wiki) and look around in the current files first. If you do not see it there, then create an issue and tag it as a question. If you know how to get in contact with me (Joe) outside of GitHub, that is probably a better approach.
