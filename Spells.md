# Spells
A spell is a unit of magic that can be created relatively at will. Casting a spell generally requires both gesticulating wildly and speaking in a firm, stern voice - if a spell is an exception, it will be noted in its description.

Every spell has several details associated with it:
* __Tier__: A rough measure of power, between 1 and 10. Your level must be at least double the spell's tier to cast it, except for 1st-Tier spells, which anyone can cast. Many spell can be cast at multiple tiers to augment their power.
* __Element__: A spell's element has no mechanical effect, but it sorts them into groups. Some feats, magic items, or story events will use this value. There are five elements: Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood.
* __Casting Time__: The amount of AP required to cast the spell.
* __Casting Cost__: The amount of [HP Reduction] required to be paid to activate the spell.
* __Description__: The description of the spell's effects; the rules governing what happens when the spell is cast.
* __Range__: How far you can cast the spell. Generally comes in one of the following options:
    * _Personal_: The spell can only target you or your space.
    * _X Feet_: The spell can target any valid target within X feet.
    * _Touch_: The spell can target any valid target that you can touch.
    * _Eye_: The spell can target any valid target that you make eye contact with. In social situations, most people will make eye contact. In combat, no one will. Animals will after 1 [Round] if not in combat. A suspecting and unwilling target can avoid this spell (though an unsuspecting target cannot).
    * _Voice_: The spell can affect a valid target where your voice reaches (usually 60 feet, further if you shout, shorter if you whisper, self only if you say nothing).
    * _Sight_: The spell can affect a valid target that you can see. While [Blinded], you can only target yourself.
    * _Connection_: The spell can affect any valid target you have a connection to. The spell will define what "connection" means - sometimes as little as knowing their name, sometimes having one of their possessions or a part of their body.
* __Duration__: How long the spell lasts. Generally comes in one of the following options:
    * _Instantaneous_: The spell effect occurs as soon as you finish casting the spell and does not continue afterward.
    * _Concentration_: The spell begins immediately and lasts as long as you spend a [Fast Action] each [Round] concentrating on it.
    * _Sun_: The spell lasts until the sun next rises or sets.
    * _Moon_: The spell lasts until both the full and new moon have set.
    * _X time periods_: The spell lasts until X time periods have gone by. This could be 3 [Rounds], 2 weeks, 6 days, or 1 year, for example.
* __Target__: What the spell can target. Generally comes in one of the following options:
    * _X Creatures_: The spell can target up to X creatures.
    * _X-ft Burst_: The spell targets a single 5-foot square, and all squares within X feet of it. You only need line of effect to the target square. A burst cannot go around obstacles.
    * _X-ft Aura_: This functions as an X-ft Burst, except that it can bleed around obstacles (though not further than X feet).
    * _X-ft Line_: The spell targets a single 5-foot square, and all squares up to X feet away in a straight line.
    * _X-ft Cone_: The spell targets a single 5-foot square, and all squares within X feet of it along a 90-degree arc (quarter-circle).
    * _Room_: The spell affects a clearly enclosed space and all targets within it. For example: a broom cupboard, the nave of a cathedral, or a forest clearing, but not an alpine valley or a room-sized volume of empty space.
    * _Boundary_: The spell affects everything within a boundary, such as the edge of a forest, the shores of a lake, the edge of a farm plot, or the walls of a city. There must be a clear boundary - this cannot affect abritrary space.
